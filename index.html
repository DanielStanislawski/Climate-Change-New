            <div class="text">The climate can be described as the average weather over a period of time.  Climate change means a significant change in the measures of climate, such as temperature, rainfall, or wind, lasting for an extended period – decades or longer. The Earth's climate has changed many times during the planet's history, with events ranging from ice ages to long periods of warmth.  What’s different about this period of the earth’s history is that human activities are significantly contributing to natural climate change through our emissions of greenhouse gases. This interference is resulting in increased air and ocean temperatures, drought, melting ice and snow, rising sea levels, increased rainfall, flooding and other influences.</div>

        <p>Deforestation is an important factor related <br> To global warming.With the rate <br> Of increasing deforestation, the impact on <br> Climate grows.The global warming is <br> Caused mainly due to increase in <br> Co2 in the atmosphere.the trees <br> Take in Co2 and gives out <br> Oxygen.Therefore, due to decreasement of trees, <br> The rate of CO2 increases in <br> The atmosphere.This is how, <br> By which the deforestation is related with global warming.</p>

        <p><br>When fossil fuels are burned, they <br> release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse <br> gases, which in turn trap heat <br> in our atmosphere, making them the <br> primary contributors to global warming and <br> climate change.</p>

        <p>Agriculture contributes to climate change both <br> by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases <br> and by the conversion of non-agricultural <br> land such as forests into agricultural <br> land. Agriculture, forestry and land-use <br> change contributed around 20 to 25% <br> of global annual emissions in 2010.</p>

            <div class="top-left"><hr>Global climate is projected to <br> continue to change over this <br> century and beyond. The magnitude <br> of climate change beyond the <br> next few decades depends primarily <br> on the amount of heat-trapping <br> gases emitted globally, and how sensitive <br> the Earth’s climate is to those emissions.<hr>Droughts in the Southwest and heat <br> waves (periods of abnormally hot weather <br> lasting days to weeks) everywhere <br> are projected to become more <br> intense, and cold waves less intense everywhere.<hr>The intensity, frequency and duration of <br> North Atlantic hurricanes, as well <br> as the frequency of the strongest <br>(Category 4 and 5) hurricanes, have all increased since <br> the early 1980s. The relative <br> contributions of human and natural causes <br> to these increases are still uncertain. <br> Hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates <br> are projected to increase as <br> the climate continues to warm.<hr>Global sea level has risen by<br> about 8 inches since reliable record <br> keeping began in 1880. It is projected <br>to rise another 1 to 8 feet <br> by 2100. This is the result of added <br> water from melting land ice <br> and the expansion of seawater as it warms.<hr></div>
